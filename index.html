                        <p class="lead"> Health has a signficant involvement in society. Almost every single breathing human being has been to a medical setting at some point in their life. In fact, it has been a first ever sight for a majorty of people. Evidently, medicine is fundamental, but why? What is it and how does technology pertain to it? In what ways may it evolve? For starters: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Healthcare has enabled the prospering of civilizations since the beginning of time.</li>
                            <li>Healthcare is a spectrum of concepts which conjoins factors including diagnosis, prevention, cures, treatments, etc.</li>
                            <li>Technology has and will continue to make up a significant percentage of success in the health industry.</li>

                                        <h5>Advanced blood tester</h5>
                                        A common common blood technology currently used in measuring blood activity, particularly blood pressure, is a blood pressure monitor. I want to create an improved version of this where the monitor will be able to measure other factors pertaining to blood.
                                        <h5>Diagnostic body scanner</h5>
                                        MRI technology is essentially a body scanner, however, the machine has potential risks including magnetic field and radio frequency risk. Additionally, the scans are not covered when they are not medically necessary. I want to create a body scanner which is guaranteed to be safe and inexpensive to use.
                                        <h5>Tissue regeneration technology</h5>
                                        There is currently medicine which is associated with faster and efficient healing. I want to expand on this technology and compile a system of devices to create a regenerative machine which can be used in critical conditions.
                                        <h5>Chemical imbalance medicine</h5>
                                        I want to expand on medicine which exists to balance chemicals in the brain. Mental issues take up a majority of the world and to research more efficient medical alternatives would naturally lessen the effect.
                                        <h5>Artificial 3d organ printers</h5>
                                        These printers would be able to create functioning organs in replacement of damaged ones at a faster rate.
                                        <h5>Robotics</h5>
                                        Robots are commonly used in manufacturing, packaging, transport, exploration, surgery, weaponry, research, safety, etc.
                                        Health wise, robots can be used to perform a humanâ€™s job at a more efficient and faster rate
                                        This could speed up healing process in patients the same way the other listed technologies are able to
                                        Robotics essentially combines all the guidelines associated with healthcare making this field  and its technology greatly in demand in regards to successful regeneration.
