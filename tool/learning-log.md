##### Links you used today (websites, videos, etc)

My partner and I created a wireframe to have a rough draft of our project. This is to help us envision certain parts in a general way but as we gradually continue to edit our content to be more thorough, we'll add more details to that original layout (or even completely change it).
JS Bin
I used getbootstrap.com to research and test out different bootstrap components.

##### Things you tried, progress you made, etc

After completing our plan, we decided to also plan our individual roles in the project. For example, HTML is my responsibility while the CSS is my partner's. Some parts, however, we decided to work on together as they were complex tasks which involved their own seprate individual roles.
In terms of HTML code, I was able to test out a few bootstrap components, specifically including cards, navbars, and listgroups. Ahough, I wasn't able to properly execute these components in JS Bin, I was able to get a rough idea of what I wanted to incorporate into the project.
These are the components I tinkered with:
Navbar
<ul>
<li><a href="Navbar">Home</a></li>
<li><a href="Navbar">News</a></li>
<li><a href="Navbar">Contact</a></li>
<li><a href="Navbar">About</a></li>
</ul>
Card
<div class="card">
<img src="img_avatar.png" alt="Avatar" style="width:100%">
<div class="container">
  <h4>  Lorem ipsum </h4>
  <p>  Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt mollit anim id est laborum</p>
</div>
</div>
Listgroup
 <ul>
  <li>Lorem ipsum</li>
  <li>Lorem ipsum</li>
  <li>Lorem ipsum</li>
</ul>

##### Challenges, a-ha moments, etc

Upon initially starting our plan, I was lost on the concept on bootstrap in terms of its sub categories. This included cards, collapse, dropdowns, etc. I'm now beginning to slowly learn about the various components and now realize that bootstrap, as a whole, is a complex system.

##### Questions you still have

What components of bootstrap might be more applicable to certain categories of content? Are there general links?

##### What you're going to try next

I'm going to continue to try to research and execute more bootstrap code to see what's most fit for the given project content.
